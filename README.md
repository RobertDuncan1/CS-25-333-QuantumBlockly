# Quantum Computing for K-12 with Blockly

## Project Description
### Synopsis
- Currently there isn't a simple medium to introduce students who are new to Computer Science and programming conepts to the world of Quantum Computing. Our project aims to simplify quantum computing for students so it's less intimidating and fun to learn.
### Description
- We are proposing a web application that will be a hub for partially developed puzzle to be completed by the user with a block programming interface. The interface will contain the necessary blocks to complete solutions to the given problems -- including specialized blocks that will communicate with a quantum computer in the backed to solve a given problem. The problems will be also be developed by administrators/teachers with a provided block programming interface.
- In using block programming in the development of these games and in the utilization of a quantum computer, our solution will provide a visual and less daunting way of programming with quantum computers.
